Huh, it’s really quiet. Also kinda… dank? Hey, is that a pool over there or something? Maybe some kind of underground lake? 
Yikes, sure hope whatever is in this package is waterproof. Something tells me the box might get a little soggy. I mean, where am I supposed to leave it anyway?

Geez, no house, no mailbox, no note, and he’s not even down here to receive it himself! I mean, why would you leave your dungeon on the day your delivery is scheduled for?
