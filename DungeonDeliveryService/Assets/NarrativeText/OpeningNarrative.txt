{i}Dungeons: {w=0.5}Nothing is more synonymous with the art of adventuring.{/i}
{i}Most adventurers seek out dungeons for two reasons: Monsters & Treasure.{/i}
{i}Slaying foes and claiming their loot is what all great warriors strive for.{/i}
{i}But one question is always left to be asked by novices in the adventuring field:{/i} {w=0.5}how do monsters get loot in the first place?{/i}
{i}Sure, some comes from fallen adventures from failed expeditions, but what treasure were those adventurers seeking?{/i}
{i}Obviously there had to have already been something there, just waiting for a brave hero to find it!{/i}
{i}That is where we here at Dungeon Delivery Services (DDS for short) come in.{/i}
{i}From decrepit daggers to apocalyptic artifacts, DDS has it all. Our company prides itself for its ability to accommodate any monster’s needs.{/i}
{i}So, if you’re a monster who wishes they had loot to make the heroes swoon, you know who to call! If your dungeon needs it, we can deliver it!{/i}
{i}Indeed, were it not for the DDS, no quest would hardly be half the activity they are today.{/i}

Alright, this is the dungeon. Oh man, time for my first official delivery as a DDS employee! This is gonna be great!
Okay, settle down man, keep it smooth. You’re a professional now! Management won’t like it if we mess around on our first day after all.
Just get in there, deliver those packages, and get out before! So, let’s see here…

Okay, one main delivery for a… K. R. Ken? Alright then. Package seems light enough, shouldn’t be too hard.
Oh! Got a few side deliveries too. Looks like they’re all on the way, so I should take care of those first! Good thing I remembered them!
Looks like this first one is addressed to some Goblins. Better get on it then! Onward ho!
