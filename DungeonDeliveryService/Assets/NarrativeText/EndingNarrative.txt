And so, my first day as an employee for the Dungeon Delivery Service officially comes to a close. 
{w=.05}What. {w=.05}A. {w=.05}Day.
Not gonna lie, it wasn’t exactly what I was expecting.
Economically unaware goblins. 
A rather fetching werewolf. 
Perverted storage containers. 
An eccentric evil old man, and... 
Um...
Ancient calamari, I guess.
Look, I knew working for the DDS was going to end with me encountering a lot of strange folks, but that? Seems like a little bit much for my first time on the job, ya know?
And those puzzles? Yeesh.
Whose idea was it to install a giant wind passage anyway? And someone really has to do something about all those rickety bridges.
I guess it was pretty interesting, though. Just because things were a little bit rough, doesn’t mean it wasn’t kinda fun too, right?
Without rough patches, everything would be too easy and expected. Gotta have those odd moments to shake things up, eh?
I mean, if adventurers are going to be making their way through here at some point, I guess stocking the dungeons ought to be its own adventure too!
Sure, it might not be the same as wandering around vanquishing darkness as a paladin, or as shooting giant fire and ice storms as a wizard-
-but I can’t deny that it’s a lot more unique from this angle.
Who knows what treasures I’ll be able to deliver next?
Whatever they are, I hope they're good ones!
...
Thanks for playing!
