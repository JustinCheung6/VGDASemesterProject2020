::Player::
Huh… This place seems… Off. 

::???::
Mo’graffo kiinerko resh va hatrol vokk…

::Player::
{w=0.5}Really off.
What was? Some sort of weird chanting?
I mean, I guess I should still knock. Gosh, I hope whoever that is doesn’t mind the interruption.

Hmph...

::Player::
Uh, hello? Sir? {size=8}I hope you’re a “sir.”{/size}

::???::
Who are you, to have come to my abode?

::Player::
Um...

::???::
Are you a lowly peasant? Perhaps you were curious where this cave led to? Or could you be some simple-minded hero? 
Are you here to destroy the evil which I have wrought upon this world?

::Player::
The what now?

::???::
Be warned fool. You are dealing with powers stronger than you could ever realize.
I harness the primal forces that built this world and which still hold this world together.
My darkness has torn the light from thousands of warriors, paladins and priests.

::Player::
Uh, sir?

::???::
{b}I HAVE DEFILED AND DEFIED GODS! I AM THE DESTROYER OF-{/b}

::Player::
Yes sir, it’s right here! That’ll be… Wait… 50 MILLION GOLD?

::Necromancer::

::Player::
O-oh... Okay. Yeah, that covers totally covers it.
Phew! I was about to have a heart attack thinking of how to carry all that!

::Necromancer::
Yes, of course you were. The package?

::Player::
Oh, right! Here you are sir!

::Necromancer::
Yes… Excellent! With this, my plans will finally be completed! Muahahaha!

::Player::
Hey, if you don’t mind me asking: What kind of book costs 50 million gold?

::Necromancer::
Hmph, of course someone of your caliber hasn’t heard of it. This, my friend, is the first book of evil. The container of all things heinous in the world of literacy! 
Why, this has the power to bend the very world to its reader’s will! This, my friend, is the…

::Necromancer::
NECRONOMICON!
MUAHAHAHAHA!

::Player::
Ah, yes! I see! I {i}totally{/i} understand the Necronomicon!I absolutely love the part about the, ya know, smiting people and stuff, eh?

::Necromancer::
...

::Player::
Well sir, I’d love to nerd out with you about evil books, but I’m afraid I just gotta finish up my deliveries!

::Necromancer::
Good. Have a nice day.

::Player::
You-

::Necromancer::
Ho'greeth for'ato!

::Null::
*SLAM*

::Player::
-too... Huh...
Did the DDS have a code of ethics? I don’t remember having to sign one. I should proooooobably ask about that when I get back. 
Best to think about that later though, I’ve only got one package left! 
Just the one addressed to Mr. K.R. Ken. 
At least that name sounds relatively normal. Better get going!
Packages Ho!
...
Okay, I think I'm actually getting worse at these inspirational delivery cries.
